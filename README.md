# cosc310-WordCount
This program uses a binary search tree to store words read in from a file. Each key in the tree represents a word and the value associated with each key is the corresponding count i.e. (number of times that word occurred in the text file). Finally, the program prints a report of each word and its count in alphabetical order.
